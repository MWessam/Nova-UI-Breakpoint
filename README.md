So all that you will need to do to use this is to create 2 new game objects.
One that has the component ResponsiveUIManager
And the other has the component WindowResizeManager

Window Resize Manager:
! [Window Resize Manager] (.../Resources/Window Resizer.png)

Responsive UI Manager:
! [Responsive UI Manager] (.../Resources/Responsive UI.png)

In Responsive UI Manager,
Define your breakpoint viewports.

Make sure to assign event by clicking on Assign Changed Resolution Event!
If you don't, it wont work.
If it doesnt work for any reason try assigning event again. should fix!
